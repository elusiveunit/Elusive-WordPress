The mini-syntax for the loop snippets goes as follows, with `wploop` as the 'base':

+ `c` for custom WP_Query (i.e. `$var->have_posts()`)
+ `h` for 'HTML friendly', which keeps the statements in `<?php ... ?>` tags
+ `e` for 'extended', which has line breaks between `if` and `while`

The order follows the list above (`wploopche`, `wploopce`...).
